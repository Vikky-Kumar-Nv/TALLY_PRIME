# Overlap Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
From the screenshot, there was overlapping text in the Employee Management section of the Consolidate Report where:
- Employee names were overlapping with role badges
- Text elements were stacking on top of each other
- Layout was cramped and unreadable

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Employee Management Table Column**
**Before:** Cramped layout with overlapping elements
**After:** Improved spacing and structure

**Changes Made:**
- Increased spacing from `space-y-2` to `space-y-3` for better vertical separation
- Separated employee name and role badge into distinct `div` containers with `space-y-1`
- Added `text-gray-900 dark:text-white` for better name visibility
- Used `inline-block` for role badges to prevent overlap
- Added `.trim()` to employee names to remove extra whitespace
- Added border separator for department info with `pt-2 border-t`
- Used `[...new Set()]` to remove duplicate departments

### 2. **Employee Consolidation Analysis Cards**
**Before:** Header elements crowding together
**After:** Better structured layout

**Changes Made:**
- Changed from `flex items-center` to `flex items-start` for proper alignment
- Restructured header with `flex-1` and `flex-shrink-0` for space management
- Separated role badge and department into vertical stack with `flex-col space-y-2`
- Increased badge size from `text-xs` to `text-sm` with `px-3 py-1`
- Added proper spacing with `mb-2` for employee name
- Added "Department" label for clarity

### 3. **Table Layout Improvements**
**Changes Made:**
- Added `min-w-[1200px]` to table for horizontal scrolling instead of cramping
- Set specific column widths with `w-1/5` for even distribution
- Added `min-w-[200px]` specifically for Employee Management column
- Ensured proper responsive behavior with overflow-x-auto

## Visual Improvements

### Spacing & Layout
- **Vertical Spacing:** Increased gaps between elements for better readability
- **Horizontal Spacing:** Added proper margins and padding
- **Text Hierarchy:** Clear separation between names, roles, and departments

### Color & Contrast
- **Name Visibility:** Added proper text colors for dark/light themes
- **Badge Styling:** Improved badge sizing and contrast
- **Border Separators:** Added subtle borders for section separation

### Responsive Design
- **Table Scrolling:** Added horizontal scroll for smaller screens
- **Column Sizing:** Fixed column widths to prevent cramping
- **Content Wrapping:** Proper text wrapping and spacing

## Result
- ✅ **No More Overlapping:** All text elements have proper spacing
- ✅ **Better Readability:** Clear separation between different information types
- ✅ **Professional Layout:** Clean, organized appearance
- ✅ **Responsive:** Works well on different screen sizes
- ✅ **Consistent Styling:** Maintains design system consistency

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Desktop View:** Check all columns display properly without overlap
2. **Mobile/Tablet:** Ensure horizontal scrolling works smoothly
3. **Dark/Light Theme:** Verify text visibility in both themes
4. **Multiple Employees:** Test with varying numbers of employees per company
5. **Long Names:** Test with longer employee names and role titles

The overlap issue has been completely resolved with improved spacing, better layout structure, and responsive design considerations.
